DAV Public School, Rohini is one amongst the 700 educational institutions run under DAV College Managing Committee. The school started in 1989 with 600 students and 20 staff members. The foundation of the school was laid in 1993 by Late Shri Darbari Lal ji the then Organizing Secretary DAVCMC. The foundation of the New Building was laid in 2001 by Sh G.P. Chopraji, President DAVCMC.
 
The school now has more than 3500 students and about 150 staff members. A firm commitment to our ideals and keeping abreast with the advances in technology, together with an open mindset to constantly upgrade and implement the DAV ideology has helped the school to make its mark in the education arena in a big way. Each step forward has been aimed at providing a fresh perspective, a new insight and a more holistic view of child centric education.
