    As the Principal of the school I feel honoured and privileged,  to be a part of an educational institution, where every stakeholder is a learner and everyday is an opportunity to learn and discover. We look at ourselves as a community of learners where everyone is engaged in meaningful learning. A student's learning involves and revolves around an effective partnership between home and school and as we all know, the stronger the partnership is,the more your child will benefit. Value the staff members and appreciate their efforts, for they provide your ward...a safer home, away from their actual home.
